# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help our friend Louise identify how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze the funding outcomes by launch date, we created a pivot table that allowed us to filter our findings by year, funding category, and outcome. After making the appropriate filtering per the assignment instructions, we created with the final pivot table for our analysis. Figure 1 !![Figure 1](https://github.com/mchondr/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Theater_outcomes_vs_lauch.png) presents the results of the previously mentioned analysis. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze the funding outcomes by goal, we created a table specifying the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns per funding goal category using the countif function of excel. Then, we calculated the total number of campaigns per funding category using the sum function and relative number of events per funding category. Subsequently by selecting the goal, percent successful and failed event columns of the table, we were able to create figure 2 !![Figure 2](https://github.com/mchondr/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_goals.png), which presents the results of the previously mentioned analysis. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No significant challenges encountered. Considering that this dataset is quite large, significant data analysis skills are required to perform an accurate data analysis.

## Results
### Outcomes based on Lauch Date
The majority of campaigns had a funding goal between $1000 and $4,999 and most of them were successful. Campaigns with the high success rates had a funding goal less than $5000. The next most successful funding goal range is between $35,000 and $44,999. 

### Outcomes based on Lauch Goals
May is probably the best month to launch a funding campaign as the majority of successful campaigns were launched during that month. 

### Limitations
There are different factors that can affect the success of the campaign that may not have been included in this dataset. Moreover, historic data cannot necessarily be used to accurately predict future outcomes. 

## other possible outcomes
Further analysis can be performed to assess the effect of other possible contributing factors to the success of the campaign. Additionally, multivariate analysis can be performed to account for a combination of factors that can potentially affect the success of a campaign.
